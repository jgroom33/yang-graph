The cert-to-name entry's fingerprint determines whether the list entry is a match; 1) If the cert-to-name list entry's fingerprint value matches that of the presented certificate, then consider the list entry a successful match. 2) If the cert-to-name list entry's fingerprint value matches that of a locally held copy of a trusted CA certificate, and that CA certificate was part of the CA certificate chain to the presented certificate, then consider the list entry a successful match. Once a matching cert-to-name list entry has been found, the map-type is used to determine how the name associated with the certificate should be determined. See the map-type leaf's description for details on determining the name value. If it is impossible to determine a name from the cert-to-name list entry's data combined with the data presented in the certificate, then additional cert-to-name list entries MUST be searched to look for another potential match. Security administrators are encouraged to make use of certificates with subjectAltName fields that can be mapped to names so that a single root CA certificate can allow all child certificates' subjectAltName fields to map directly to a name via a 1;1 transformation.",
