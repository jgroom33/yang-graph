If the configuration of a system-controlled interface cannot be used by the system (e.g., the interface hardware present does not match the interface type), then the configuration is not applied to the system-controlled interface shown in the operational state. If the configuration of a user-controlled interface cannot be used by the system, the configured interface is not instantiated in the operational state. System-controlled interfaces created by the system are always present in this list in the operational state, whether or not they are configured.",
