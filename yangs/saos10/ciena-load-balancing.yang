            For Example, on an LSR, if speculative-hashing is off, only the MPLS Labels will be considered for ECMP/LAG hashing.
            Whereas, if speculative-hashing is on, the payload after MPLS Labels could also be considered with some speculation
            as to what that payload is for ECMP/LAG hashing purposes.
            If speculative-hashing is on, for example, if 4 is seen in the first nibble after the MPLS labels, the payload could
            be deemed to be IPv4, if 6 is seen it could be deemed to be IPv6 and more..";
