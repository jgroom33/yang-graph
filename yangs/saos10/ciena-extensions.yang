         indicate that the corresponding string value should be stored and
         reported in encrypted format.

         Clients reading the configuration or applied configuration for
         the node should expect to receive only the encrypted value.
         Values written in cleartext will be encrypted and stored in encrypted format.
         And backend application may be able to retrieve the clear text
         password from the encrypted value and can use it for protocol based
         authentication.

         When using the extension, the input string must have maximum length upto
         128 characters. After encryption the data node will hold the encrypted string.";
